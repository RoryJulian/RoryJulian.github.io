                    <br>
                    <h4><a href="https://ncirl.ie/">National College of Ireland</a></h4>
                <h5>MSc. in Marketing (2016-2018)</h5>
                <br>
                <p>A growing interest in Marketing Strategy and Business Development coupled with a passion for continuous learning and development motivated me to undertake an MSc. in Marketing part time, studying in the evenings and weekends while simultaneously gaining valuable work experience. The MSc. in Marketing programme comprises of a carefully selected range of both contemporary and fundamental marketing topics and thus caters for multinational organisations, indigenous SME initiatives and entrepreneurial enterprises. Just some of the key areas of study included Digital Marketing Strategy; Market Research Methods; Strategic Project Management; Integrated Marketing Communications and Consumer Behaviour. My curiosity around how consumers interact with their favourite brands led me to research whether Leinster Rugby fans exhibit the characteristics of a brand community, and I ultimately completed my Dissertation on this topic in August 2018.</p>
                <br>
                <h4><a href="https://tudublin.ie/">Technological University Dublin</a></h4>
                <h5>Product Design (2011 - 2015)</h5>
                <br>
                <p>The BSc. in Product Design aims to equip graduates with the theoretical and practical knowledge necessary to successfully conceptualise, design and move innovative ideas through the development cycle, and ultimately establish a go-to-market strategy. This course helped me to develop and nurture a wide variety of skills including creative problem-solving; social intelligence; complex critical thinking and the ability to be a lifelong learner, as well as igniting a keen interest in Marketing Strategy and Business Development. The Dissertation topic I chose as part of this course was to design, develop and market a product to prevent the occurrence of acute ankle injuries. Some achievements from my time in this course include being awarded with 'Outstanding Assistive Technology Concept working with Enable Ireland' as well as reaching the finals of the PolyU Global Student Challenge, which was held in the Hong Kong Polytechnic University.</p>
